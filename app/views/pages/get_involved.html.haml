          What does it all mean?
        %p
          Open source is about individuality, transparency, creativity, and destiny.  It is about having an idea, and making it reality.  Diaspora was founded about fulfilling a passion for fun, and making the internet a better place.
          open source is what enables us to change the world, for ourselves, and let our friends across the web benefit from our exploration.

        %p
          open source communities are amazing things.  At Diaspora, we believe that people should be valued by what they do.  It does not matter if you have contributed to a project before, or are an elite open source hacker.
          Contributing Diaspora means that you get to work on hard problems, with a focus on solutions that work for users.

          This is why if you contribute something meaningful to Diaspora, we will give you core commit access(what does that mean?). 
          We are in this together, so giving excited people the change to make huge changes always trumps keeping control sacred.

        %h4
          Where you come in
        %p
          We all make Diaspora.  We might not know you just yet, but we think you'd be a great fit to the future of the web.  You're fantastic, and you're ready to change the world.
        %p
          Contributing to Diaspora comes in all different shapes and sizes.  Whether you're a user helping us find bugs, providing feedback on our mailing lists, contributing code or design, we thank you.
