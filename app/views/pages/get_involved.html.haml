    what does open source mean to Diaspora?
  %p
    it is about individuality, transpareny, creativity, and destiny.  It is about having an idea, and making it reality.  Diaspora was founded about fulfilling a passion for fun, and making the internet a better place.

    open source is what enables us to change the world, for ourselves, and let our friends across the web benifit from our exploration.

  %p
    open source communites are amazing things.  At Diaspora, we beleive that people should be valued by what they do.  It does not matter if you have contirbuted to a project before, or are an elite open source hacker.
    Contributing Diaspora means that you get to work on hard problems, with a focus on solutions that work for users.

    This is why if you contribute something meaningful to Diaspora, we will give you core commit access(what does that mean?). 
    We are in this together, so giving excited people the change to make huge changes always trumps keeping control sacred.
